<h2 id="copy">Copy</h2>
<p>The World of Charles Dickens has never been more interactive and inviting that in this fast-moving, comedy romp. Preposterous names, ludicrous coincidences and crowd rousing melodrama will delight and astound you, I’ll wager a hundred gold sovereigns!</p>
<p>Come watch the fate of unruly urchins and penny pinching priests as they struggle in their journey to find love and fortune, against adversity, poverty and wickedness. Join us in sumptuous drawing rooms, murky streets and smoky taverns to meet sailors, snobs and silk laden ladies.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, the audience invent the show’s title – so no two performances are ever the same!</p>
