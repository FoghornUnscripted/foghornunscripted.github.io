<h2 id="copy">Copy</h2>
<p>Sip your Gin on the elegant terrace of Winterbourne House as Foghorn Unscripted entertain you with their comedic homage to those quintessentially British Whodunitsâ€¦ Was it the Butler or the
impoverished Lady of the Manor? Did they use a candle stick or a feather duster to carry out their murderous antics. Or was it a staged accident involving a blunt spoon and a boiled egg?!</p>
<p>We need you, the audience, to join our experienced performers and help unmask the murderer.</p>
<p>This hilarious show comes to the historic Winterbourne House and Garden for two special outdoor performances. We promise: no audience members will be harmed in the making of these shows!</p>
