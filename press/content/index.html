<h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3>
<p>Exciting and innovative storytelling, twisted by the audience!</p>
<p>As a theatre company, Midlands based Foghorn Unscripted has been working together for over 10 years appearing in venues such as Midlands Arts Centre, Lichfield Garrick, Blue Orange, AE Harris, The Artrix and the Old Joint Stock Theatre. Our most successful formats have been seen in Leicester and Brighton fringes, including a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Festival.</p>
<p>We also perform site specific work. We have partnered with <a href="https://www.winterbourne.org.uk/">Winterbourne House and Gardens</a> since 2018 producing new shows: An Improvised Haunting and Murder on the Terrace (with high tea and a gin bar provided).</p>
<p>We love improvisation and working together as a group. We train together, developing new formats and techniques, whilst also attending structured workshop &#x26; courses to upgrade our skills. Each of our shows features between 4 to 10 performers, picked from our team of trained actors.</p>
<p>Collectively, we have performed as actors, stand up comics, workshop leaders, musicians, directors and writers. Our credits include national tours, theatre in education, radio voice overs and television appearances in Doctor Who, Eastenders and Doctors.</p>
