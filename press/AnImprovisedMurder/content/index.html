<p>A night of stories, laughter, gamesâ€¦ and death!</p>
<p>A murder mystery improvised live. With no script and no plot, Foghorn Unscripted and the audience create a classic whodunnit. Who dies horribly? Who is the murderer? What awful secrets are revealed? The audience are the puppet masters and the fate of the characters are in your hands! All served up with a generous helping of jokes so you can enjoy a good old-fashioned night of murder, mystery and mayhem.</p>
<p>Foghorn Unscripted is an established group of comedy improvisers from Birmingham, UK. We perform stories, using nothing but suggestions from the audience and the power of our own imaginations.</p>
