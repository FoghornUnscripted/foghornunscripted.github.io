<p>Pull your Pint, sup your schooner of sherry and relax at our improvised pub: ‘The Fox and Foghorn’.</p>
<p>Our merry band of performers will entertain you with bawdy games, songs and stories that will be more fulfilling than a scotch egg. There’ll be no short measures of laughs in this hilarious show, coming to a pub near you!</p>

<p>Remember when your local pub was a proper local, and not a fancy craft beer bar? When a pint was less than a tenner and your dinner was a cheese or ham roll in cling film? Join us for an entirely improvised proper pub session. A quiz, a clairvoyant and a sing song…</p>
