<p>Foghorn Unscripted was created in 2012. We initially performed at The Old Joint Stock theatre in a monthly slot. After a sell-out Edinburgh show we decided to allow ourselves a break from monthly shows and started touring the country with our main shows.</p>

<p>If the only improv you’ve seen is Whose Line is it Anyway then you’re really going to love what we do! We create new and innovative show formats and ways of doing improvisation. You’re guaranteed to see something different and exciting when you come to one of our shows as well as something wacky, surreal and hilarious!</p>
