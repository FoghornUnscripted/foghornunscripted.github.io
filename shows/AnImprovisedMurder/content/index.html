<p>In this show â€“ we improvise a murder mystery live.</p>
<p>No script. No plot.</p>
<p>Using audience suggestions we create a classic whodunnit. Who dies horribly? Who is the murderer? What awful secrets are revealed? The audience are the puppet masters and the fate of the characters are in their hands! All served up with a generous helping of jokes so you can enjoy a good old-fashioned night of murder, mystery and mayhem.</p>
